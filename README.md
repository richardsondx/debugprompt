## Categories Overview

| Category                | Description                                                                                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Error Diagnosis         | Identifying why an error occurs, highlighting root causes and solutions.                           |
| Data Flow Tracing       | Tracking how data moves through the system by highlighting components and interactions.            |
| Approach Comparison     | Evaluating different methods to solve a problem, noting trade-offs like efficiency and readability.|
| Pseudocode Analysis     | Converting logic into structured steps, focusing on identifying gaps and edge cases.                |
| Assumption Testing      | Validating hypotheses about bugs through rigorous testing and verification.                      |
| Refactoring             | Improving code structure without changing functionality, emphasizing clean code and maintainability. |
| Performance Tuning      | Optimizing speed and resource usage by addressing bottlenecks and efficiency improvements.         |
| Prompt Iteration        | Refining prompts for better AI responses, focusing on clarity and specificity.                     |
| Test Generation         | Creating tests to cover various scenarios through automated checks and edge case consideration.    |
| Environment Debugging   | Fixing setup and configuration issues to ensure compatibility across environments.               |
| Security Analysis       | Identifying vulnerabilities and protecting the system against threats.                           |
| Edge Case Handling      | Managing unexpected inputs with a focus on robustness and validation.                            |
| Logic Breakdown         | Dissecting complex algorithms to understand components and flow.                                |
| Dependency Debugging    | Resolving issues with third-party dependencies including conflicts and compatibility problems.   |
| Code Optimization       | Enhancing efficiency and readability using best practices and design patterns.                   |

These categories map to the entire debugging lifecycle ‚Äì from detecting issues (Error Diagnosis) to preventing recurrence (Test Generation). They reflect modern challenges like AI hallucination mitigation (Prompt Iteration) and dependency hell resolution (Dependency Debugging).
